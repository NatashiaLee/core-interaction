      <h1>BRAND IDENTITY SYSTEM</h1>
        <p>A Brand Identity System is a collection of elements which work together to create unified, consistent and flexible brand assets that communicate the brand value to the target audience effectively. This collection of elements constitutes of 6 major brand assets including the primary brand mark or logo, secondary brand mark, color palette, typography, visual brand extensions (such as official brand pattern, iconography etc) and brand tone (which includes visual image and photo standards as well as the tone of voice in all messaging and communications). The first step in creating a brand identity system is research. Figuring out brand characteristics (e.g. accessible, trustworthy, experience, community), brand personality (e.g. approachable, confident, energetic, sincere, smart) before moving to design drivers (e.g. warm (color/typography (humanist), strong, authentic, informed, familiar) where you start developing designs.

          <p>The final step would be creating a brand style guide to establish guidelines and ensure visual consistency. For example, logos need to be adapted for different uses. The brand style guide shows vendors variations of the logo: full color, reversed out, grayscale, and solid black. It also outlines what is considered “on brand”. For example, photographs may require a specific lighting, focus, or color overlay applied. In addition to these basics, you also have to show how the brand will look in real-life applications, which will help vendors understand how you expect your brand to look across other communication pieces.

      <p>While doing research, I also found a design studio I was really inspired by. <a href="basicagency.com">Basic Agency’s</a> approach to branding in today’s digital age focuses on bringing human interaction to technology and really building an identity that connects with the people. One of their cases I was most intrigued by was the community branding of a ‘live, work, and play’ neighborhood in San Diego: <a href="https://basicagency.com/case-studies/makers-quarter-community-branding">Makers Quarter</a>, in which they created a design system that reinforced a sense of people in public spaces and community interaction.
