      <h1>REBRANDING: CHOBANI CASE STUDY</h1>
        <p>Rebranding is the process of redesigning elements of the brand identity in order to realign your messaging and perception. This can include a new name, logo redesign, new colors, new messaging, and other core changes to the brand identity. Good reasons to rebrand include: The need to differentiate the business from competitors, the need to remain relevant to consumers in a changing market place, product differentiation, a fundamental change in the business positioning and ownership change. Rebranding is not something that should be done often or with little care. However, when done correctly, it can be a vital step in moving forward. Take the recent case of Choboni for example.

          <p>The number-one-selling brand of yogurt in the country, Chobani was one of the pioneers of the growth of the popularity of greek yogurt. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in competition, resulting in a lot of similar products on the market. Because of the uniformity of products and designs available in the marketplace, their growth had begun to stagnate. Hence in the effort to stay ahead of the curve, Chobani decided to rebrand itself. More specifically, a rethink on the positioning of our company for future growth. Inspired by the folk art of the 19th century, their new packaging features bright and vivid hand-drawn illustrations of fruit that look as if they were lifted from a calendar straight out of the American Folk Art Museum.  This lends an old-fashioned, vintage feel to the product that is rarely seen in mainstream consumer packaged foods. This new aesthetic also allows them to position Chobani for its expected move beyond its identity as just a yogurt company into a “food-focused wellness company,” that uses food as "a force of good."
