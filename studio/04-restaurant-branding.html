      <h1>RESTAURANT BRANDING</h1>
        <p>Branding is important for restaurants because it gives them the opportunity to establish brand loyalty with their customers. But to create a cohesive brand requires a lot of attention to the following 10 elements.</p>
        <h2>1. Concept</h2>
        <p>Figuring out the restaurant concept such as style of food, type of service, and other distinguishing features is the first step to creating a successful identity.</p>
        <h2>2. Demographics</h2>
        <p>Who is the target audience of the restaurant? Are you aiming to serve families, romantic couples, businesspeople, or some combination? Are they trendy or traditional? What’s your customers’ price point?
        </p>
        <h2>3. Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>What is the main purpose of the business and what is its selling point? Arguably the most important element in branding, the mission statement is used to figure out the direction of the restaurant and help guide the rest of the decisions about all the other elements of the brand.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Name</h2>
<p>A restaurant name should be unique and memorable. It should give guests a good sense of what kind of food the restaurant serves and what type of restaurant it is.
</p>
<h2>5. Logo</h2>
<p>A well-chosen font or symbol can be just as effective in summing up the feeling of your business on your signage, website, menu, and advertising. Symbols are not essential.
</p>
<h2>6. Tagline</h2>
<p>A catchy interpretation of the mission statement, a tagline is a brief statement (typically no more than 5 words) that sums up the defining feature of a brand.
</p>
<h2>7. Website</h2>
<p>The website will likely be the very first impression guests will have of the business, so designing a website that’s easy to understand and visually appealing is necessary.
</p>
<h2>8. Ambiance</h2>
<p>Restaurant ambiance is extremely important in creating the mood of your business. These include paying attention to details such as lighting, menus, interior design elements, serverware, barware, color scheme, music, server clothing etc…
</p>
<h2>9. Branded Merchandise</h2>
<p>To attract more customers and further establish brand loyalty, branded merchandise such as pens and stationary, tote bags and mugs can be a nice addition to the restaurant. The more your customers share your logo, the better brand recognition you’ll get.
</p>
<h2>10. Food</h2>
<p>Finally, menu planning is a huge component of your restaurant brand. From the ingredients you use to the name of each dish, should match with your mission statement. For example, if the restaurant is advertised as a farm-to-table establishment, how and where the food is sourced is extremely vital.</p>
