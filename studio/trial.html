      <h1> Gendered Designs</h1>
      <p>Feminine fonts are cursive, thin, slanted or smooth. Masculine fonts have straight lines, sharp edges and geometric lines. Feminine handwritten fonts are usually decorated or bubbly, while masculine ones are geometric and sharp. Gender neutral fonts include classic fonts that are considered readable and safe for web use.

Brands that were rated as highly adventurous, aggressive, brave, daring, dominant, and sturdy were classified by the researchers as having masculine personalities; examples would be Adidas, Audi and Mercedes. Those rated as expressing “tender feelings” and being fragile, graceful, sensitive, and sweet were classified as feminine, such as Dove, Nivea and Chanel. If brands seek to emphasize empathy, they might embrace more female characteristics, whereas if they are driven more by price and efficiency, it might send them in a masculine direction.</p></div>
