    <h1>GENDER MARKETING</h1>
      <div class="btext">
        <p>Dove is one brand that has embraced the Genderblend movement via its recent Dove Men+Care ‘Real Strength’ campaign by championing the nurturing side of fatherhood. The global campaign plays on the traditional masculine quality of strength and relates it to men’s ability to show they care.
        </p>

        <p>The campaign uses expressive visual aids of men in their role as fathers, with the underlying aim to bring into question the definition of physical strength verse emotional strength. Campaigns like Dove’s is just one example of many recent ‘dadvertisements’ that are using powerful image to change our perceptions of fatherhood and masculinity.
